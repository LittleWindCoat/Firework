Name : LWC
Project 3: Fireworks

This is the Fireworks project. The firework has five colors and five different types, so there are 25 kinds totally. By using the sliders on the setting panel, you can switch the launch angle and speed for the trajectory. You can select the color and type of the firework by clicking the radio buttons on the left button. By clicking the button “render”, the canvas will draw the trajectory line and fireworks explosion at the same time. The firework won’t go away when you change the window size.
